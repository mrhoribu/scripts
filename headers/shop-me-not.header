  this script attempt to prevent you from accidentally shopping items that are present in READY LIST

  notes:
    1. the descriptions for your hands are not the same as in the READY LIST so it's a "best guess"
    2. scripts are unaffected by shop-me-not!
    3. you can do `sudo shop sell` to override shop-me-not
