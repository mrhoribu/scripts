  Heal the wounds of another player.
  This script does not currently handle healing down
  I usually run ;healself in background mode

  * this is a beta release, as a triage for the new
    healing updates.  If bugs are discovered, please
    message me on discord @ondreian#3875

  example :
    ;mend <Player1>, <Player2>,...<PlayerN>
