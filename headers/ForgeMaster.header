ForgeMaster, by Dintarl

Can be set up to gain skill in any or all forging disciplines.  Has options to create a forging hammer or a perfect forging hammer, and will create the hammer prior to moving on to the non-crafting disciplines.  Works in any town.

To set up:  ;forgemaster setup

Special thanks to SpiffyJr for the code used in creating the GUI. 

Should be updated to get along with ClimateWear scripts.
