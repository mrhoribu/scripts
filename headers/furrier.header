Furrier- a script to sell your skins. This can be useful for situations where selling scripts like sloot do not recognize a skin name (which is sourced from gameobj-data.xml) either directly or  

This script will grab your current room, sell your skinsack at the furrier and then deposit the contents in the bank, then return you to your starting room. You can place this in front of "sloot sell" or similar sell script in a resting routine. If you use a secondary sell script like sloot, place a "#" in front of the go2 bank lines for efficiency.
