  Package Manager

  ** THIS SCRIPT REQUIRES RUBY 2.3+ **

  https://gswiki.play.net/Lich_(software)/Installation

  A modern, federated package manager for Lich. This script provides similiar
  functionality to the ;repository, but aims to make it much easier to share
  updates to scripts and avoid relying anyone as a single point-of-failure.
  Instead of a single server, jinx supports multiple repositories to be more
  resilient against infrastructure outages or players leaving the community.
