This script is a fork and rework of joustsmart2022 done by Elanthia-online to make it more generic
and to provide updates in capabilities.  All original contributors continue to be listed.

This script attempts to improve returns on the joust by recognizing knight behavior patterns.
Four patterns are known as of this version, there appears to be one to two more or the 5th is random.
It starts by assuming a specific path to perfect joust and then adjusts based on results.
There is plenty of randomness to the jousting so keep that in mind.  The behaviors could change,
no guarantees there.

See the help info for options and configurations.
